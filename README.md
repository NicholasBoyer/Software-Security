# Software-Security

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a fictional private financial institution which manages the assets of their clientele. The company wanted to encrypt the financial data of their clients and insure that in-going and out-going communications were secure.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
It is important to code securely because insecure code can lead to costly hacks which lose a company money and damage its reputation. Software security protects a company's data as well as the data of their clients.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Initially, it was a bit difficult to get the vulnerability assessment to work. However, with a bit of web-searching and referring back to my resources, I successfully got the dependency check to run.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased my software's layers of security by using a secure hashing function, updating the dependencies, and using try-catch patterns. In the future, I would use the OWASP database in conjunction with the Maven dependency check to asses my software's vulnerabilties and develop a mitigation plan.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made sure my software was secure by working on the code iteratively. I would only write a small portion of code before compiling so that any errors or vulnerabilities introduced by the new code could be dealt with swiftly. I ran a dependency check to see if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found our textbook, Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications, to be an excellent resource. Helpful coding practices include using try-catch patterns for errors and input validation.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
To show my knowledge and experience, I would show my successful static dependency test, hash function implementation, use of the Spring framework, and creation of an SSL certificate.
